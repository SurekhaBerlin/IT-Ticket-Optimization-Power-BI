Ticket to Resolution: Optimizing IT Support Performance

In this challenge, youâ€™ll take on the role of an IT support analyst working with a dataset that looks like it came straight from a real service desk system, such as Jira Service Management. The goal is to explore and analyze support tickets to understand how the IT team handles different requests and how they can improve their performance.

This dataset includes over 1,000 IT support tickets. Each ticket is similar to what you'd see in a tool like Jira with details like:

Ticket ID, creation date, and resolution date
Subject and description of the issue or request
Response provided by the support team
Ticket priority (like High, Medium), queue, and type (e.g., Bug, Feature, Request)
Tags for category, technical topic, and documentation
Country and location info for the requester
 

Your job is to dig into the data to find patterns that can help the IT team:

Solve tickets faster
Spot common or recurring issues
Understand which requests take the most time or effort
Improve workflows and customer satisfaction
 

Key Questions to Explore
Ticket Types & Tags

What kinds of issues (bugs, requests, features) come up most often?
Which support teams or queues handle the most tickets?
How are different tags (like "Security", "Integration", or "Documentation") used?
Resolution Time & Priorities

How long does it take to resolve tickets, on average?
Do higher-priority tickets get resolved faster?
Which types of tickets take the longest to close?
Locations & Volume

Which countries or regions submit the most tickets?
Are there certain locations that see more delays or specific issues?
Process Improvement

Can we group similar tickets to create automated replies or help articles?
Are the agent responses helpful and aligned with what the user asked?
Where can the support team save time or improve service quality?
